My digital product is a set of icons based off of my favourite characters from the game, Borderlands 2. I spent a lot of time trying to make these icons look professional while also fitting in with the aesthetic of the game itself. I tried to learn and grow from the improvised feel of my design work from last year by making icons that are contained within the same grid and being mindful of the width of the lines I am using. 

I created backgrounds for each of these that match the buttons in the menus of the game as, even though I created these just for fun, I wanted some continuity between the icons and the visual standards of the game (I show examples of this in my research).

My website also includes a button that allows the user to choose line art only icons, or colour ones. I included animation to this circle button to create a point of interest that will make the user want to click on it to discover what it does.
